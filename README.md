RetroPie-profiles üíæ
====================
### RetroPie plugin to select which profile to use for save files and save states

![](https://cloudup.com/ikSCE7oQs8F+)

This is a [RetroPie][] plugin that adds an entry to the `RetroPie` "system" in
EmulationStation. It provides a UI for logging in to your RetroPie via a login
server on your mobile device.

Specifically, this plugin is responsible for setting the `savefile_directory` and
`savestate_directory` values in the `retroarch.cfg` file. This way, you can have
different "profiles" of saves for when different people are using RetroPie.

I wrote this because my brother is always coming over to my house and wants to be
able to resume his game saves from home and vice versa. When using this plugin in
combination with [`sshfs`][sshfs] we share save files and ROMs over the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è


Installation
------------

Clone the repo, or extract a tarball of `master` branch to your RetroPie and run
the `install.sh` script:

``` bash
$ curl https://github.com/TooTallNate/RetroPie-profiles/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xzvf --strip-components=1 - -C RetroPie-profiles
$ cd RetroPie-profiles
$ ./install
Putting "login.sh" in "/home/pi/RetroPie/retropiemenu/"... OK!
Putting "icon.png" in "/home/pi/RetroPie/retropiemenu/icons"... OK!
Creating a gamelist.xml entry for login.sh... OK!
```


Login Servers
-------------

The "login server" is the URL in which you will visit on your mobile device when
the login dialog is open in RetroPie to change users. The URL is specified in
the `retroarch.cfg` file under the `save_profiles_login_server` config key.

The plugin will prompt you one time for the login server URL,
if the key is not already set:

A login server can have any logic implemented for the login mechanism.
Take a look at the list of known login server implementations for some examples:

 - [Facebook Login][fb] - Login using your Facebook profile

If you would like to implement your own login server using Node.js, then
it is recommended to use the [`RetroPie-profiles-server`][server] helper.
